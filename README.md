# MeteorTrajectories
Meteor trajectory determination

In this repositories you may find a series of tools used to
reconstruct the trajectory of large meteors using public footage.
Most of these tools have been developed by the *Solar, Earth and
Planetary Physics Group* in the Institute of Physics of the University
of Antioquia (MedellÃ­n, Colombia).

Most of the data and scripts available here, correspond to what we
used to reconstruct the atmospheric trajectory of the Cuba 2019
meteor.  However, this same tools, and the methods implied, can be
applied to reconstruc the trajectory of any other large meteor.

When using this data and tools please cite the following manuscript:
